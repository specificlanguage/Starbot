# Starbot

Basic implementation of a starring messages in Discord and "pinning" them to a channel so everyone can see the message in all its glory.

If you'd like to use this (which I wouldn't recommend), you need a MongoDB instance.

It's currently incomplete, it does work, but it's not very good.

Things I want to do before final release:

- Adding a leaderboard command so people can see which messages are the best
- Adding at least some documentation to help others
